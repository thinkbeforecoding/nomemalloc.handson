Header:

Offset  Length  Name         Description

  0       4     size         The size of the entire animation file,
                             including this file header.

  4       2     magic        File format identifier. Always hex AF12.

  6       2     frames       Number of frames in the flic.  This 
                             count does not include the ring frame.  
                             FLC files have a maximum length of 4000 
                             frames.

  12      2     depth        Bits per pixel (always 8).

  14      2     flags        Set to hex 0003 after ring frame is 
                             written and flic header is updated.  
                             This indicates that the file was properly
                             finished and closed.

  16      4     speed        Number of milliseconds to delay between 
                             each frame during playback.

  20      2     reserved     Unused word, set to 0.

  22      4     created      The MSDOS-formatted date and time of the
                             file's creation.

  26      4     creator      The serial number of the Animator Pro
                             program used to create the file.  If the 
                             file was created by some other program 
                             using the FlicLib development kit, this 
                             value is hex 464C4942 ("FLIB").

  30      4     updated      The MSDOS-formatted date and time of the
                             file's most recent update.

  34      4     updater      Indicates who last updated the file.  See 
                             the description of creator.

  38      2     aspectx      The x-axis aspect ratio at which the file 
                             was created.

  40      2     aspecty      The y-axis aspect ratio at which the file 
                             was created. Most often, the x:y aspect ratio 
                             will be 1:1.  A 320x200 flic has a ratio of 
                             6:5.

  42      38    reserved     Unused space, set to zeroes.

  80      4     oframe1      Offset from the beginning of the file to the 
                             first animation frame chunk.

  84      4     oframe2      Offset from the beginning of the file to
                             the second animation frame chunk.  This value 
                             is used when looping from the ring frame back 
                             to the second frame during playback.

  88      40    reserved     Unused space, set to zeroes.

  0       4     size         The size of the frame chunk, including this
                             header and all subordinate chunks that follow.

  4       2     type         Frame chunk identifier. Always hex F1FA.

  6       2     chunks       Number of subordinate chunks in the
                             frame chunk.

Offset  Length  Name         Description

  0       4     size         The size of the chunk, including this header.

  4       2     type         Data type identifier.

  6    (size-6) data         The color or pixel data.


Chunk Type:
    25 Rle      Run Length Encoding
    27 Delta    Delta Encoding

Run Length Encoding Chunk:

    All lines start with a 1 byte Paket count

    Each paket Paket:
        1 sbyte     Control size or count
                    >= 0 => Fill. 
                            The <Control> byte is followed 
                            by a 2 bytes pixel value that 
                            must be repeated <Contol> times
                    < 0  => Copy
                            The <Control> byte is followed
                            by - <Control> 2 bytes pixels that
                            must be copied

Delta Encoding Chunk:

    The chunk starts with a 2 bytes line count. 

    Each Line starts with a header:
        2 bytes opt     Skip lines (Only if < 0)
        2 bytes         Paket count

    Each Paket:
        1 byte          Skip pixels
        1 byte          Control size or count
                        >= 0 => Copy
                        <  0 => Fill
